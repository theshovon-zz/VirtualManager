# VirtualManager - A Slack bot to check up project progress of developers. 
A chatbot that automatically confirms priorities for all team members in the morning and asks for progress status at the end of the day (stand-up). 
The bot should also monitor people's activity to proactively engage inactive contributors and follow up with people who do not complete tasks on time. 
This agent's goal is to stimulate the participation and sharing of information from all team members and finish the project on time.
The project manager makes sure all team members are working on the right thing and are productive. 
The bot should notify its owner about productivity issues for projects, tasks, and team members.
